# Functional Specification

## 1. Introduction
### 1.1 Purpose

The project consist to the creation of a webpage who simulate the behave of a fpga and output from a .v and .sdf file a blueprint of the fpga with the components and the connections between them. The document will describe the requirements of the project, including the functional and non-functional requirements, the interfaces, and the system features.

### 1.2 Scope
 
#### 1.2.1 In Scope
The project include:
- Webpage with a front end.
- Load the .v and .sdf file and output the blueprint of the fpga.
- The blueprint could be download or share as a .png file.

#### 1.2.2 Out of Scope
The project exclude:
- An actual back end of the webpage.
- The implementation of the .v and .sdf files directly from the webpage.
